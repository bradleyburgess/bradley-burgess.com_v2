While Sibelius and Finale continue to dominate the modern music notation software market, there are other options beyond these two long-standing rivals. Dorico is the new kid on the block and shows a great deal of promise; and MuseScore — for a long time the open-source underdog — has come a long, long way in recent years, to the point where I exclusively recommend it to new-comers to music engraving (until their needs outgrow what MuseScore currently offers — which is not insignificant).

But sitting quietly in the shadows is yet another heavy-hitter that is largely ignored by many musicians: LilyPond.

LilyPond ticks so many boxes: it's free (like beer and speech) and open-source, it's very fast (once you get the hang of it), it's almost upgrade-compatibility proof, you can use it on any device, and the engravings are stunning out of the box — way better than Finale or Sibelius.

The catch? It is basically music by coding.
