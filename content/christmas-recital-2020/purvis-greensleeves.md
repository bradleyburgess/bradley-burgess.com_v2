_What Child Is This?_ is one of the most well-loved carols in the
English-speaking world. The melody that accompanies this text is the famous
English folk tune, "Greensleeves". This setting of the tune by Richard Purvis
(who we heard earlier in the Carol Rhapsody) is beautiful and haunting. He had
served as bandmaster in World War II, and I was amazed to learn that he wrote
this piece in a foxhole while under enemy fire.
