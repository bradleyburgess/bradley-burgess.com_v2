We'll have just a splash of Advent, as we listen to Andrew Carter's very
French-inspired _Toccata on "Veni Emmanuel"_ (O Come, O Come, Emmanuel). This
ancient plainchant hymn is over 1,200 years old, and the tune dates to at least
the 15th-century. The words and music were first paired together in 1851, and it
has since been a much-loved Advent carol, and certainly one of my favorites.
