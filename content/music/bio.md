Praised for his “virtuoso piano playing” and his ability to leave audiences
“spellbound” (ClassicSA), Bradley Burgess is one of today’s few concert artists
who can move seamlessly between the piano bench and organ console, and enjoys a
multifaceted career as concert pianist, concert organist, and church musician.

University (Camden, NJ), Woolsey Hall (New Haven, CT), Baxter Concert Hall (Cape
Town, South Africa), and King’s Chapel (Boston, MA).

Bradley holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in piano performance from the
Manhattan School of Music in New York City, the University of Cape Town, and
Yale University’s Institute of Sacred Music and School of Music, where he was
awarded the Julie B. Sherman Prize for excellence in organ playing. He has also
been the recipient of First Prize at the Fine Music Radio / Pick ‘n Pay 101.3
Music Awards, the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust Bursary, and a generous grant from
the National Arts Council of South Africa.
