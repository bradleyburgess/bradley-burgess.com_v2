We go back in time, now, to one of the real classics of the Christmas organ
repertoire: Bach's wonderful _Fantasia on "In dulci jubilo"_, which has been a
staple Christmas Eve postlude for many organists around the world.

In the English-speaking world, we most often sing this tune with the famous
translation by John Mason Neale:

> Good Christian men, rejoice  
> With heart, and soul, and voice;  
> Give ye heed to what we say:  
> News! News!  
> Jesus Christ was born to-day:  
> Ox and ass before Him bow,  
> And He is in the manger now.  
> Christ is born today! Christ is born today.
