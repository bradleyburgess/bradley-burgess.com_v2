Like Bach, Brahms is certainly one of the composers in history closest to my
heart; unlike Bach, Brahms was by no stretch a fine organist, despite being a
wonderful pianist.

He didn't leave us very much organ music, however, the last work he
finished before his death was a beautiful set of Eleven Chorale Preludes for the
organ. His later works contain some of the most deeply introspective and
poignant writing of the 19th century, and this set is no exception.

We'll hear from this collection the lovely setting of _Lo, How a Rose E'er
Blooming_, which—while reflective—also feels quite contended.
