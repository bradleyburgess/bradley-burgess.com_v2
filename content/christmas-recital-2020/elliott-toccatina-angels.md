We being with a short and fun Toccatina on _Angels We Have Heard On High_, by
the Principal Organist of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir: Richard Elliott.

The piece is recast in 7/8 time and features accents achieved by quick
(treacherous?) back-and-forth manual changes as seen in the opening — both of
which give the music it's catchy rhythm.
