Next we have the wonderful _Carol Rhapsody_ by Richard Purvis, who was an
American organist and church musician most known for his long appointment as
Organist and Master of Choristers at Grace Cathedral in San Fransisco.

His composition style was greatly influenced by the cathedral's magnificent
Ã†olian-Skinner organ. It was one of the first true "American Classic" organs,
and the expressive, lush recordings he made on the instrument influenced a
generation of American organists.

This piece takes us through several well-loved carols, beginning with a lush and
expressive _Silent Night_, followed by a playful scherzo on _Hark! the Herald
Angels Sing_, and ending with a rousing toccata on _O Come, All Ye Faithful_.
