_What Child Is This?_ is one of the most well-loved carols in the
English-speaking world. The melody that accompanies this text is the famous
English folk tune, Greensleeves. Richard Purvis, who we heard earlier, wrote a
beautiful and haunting setting of this tune. He had served as bandmaster in
World War II, and I was amazed to learn that he wrote this piece in a foxhole
while under enemy fire.
