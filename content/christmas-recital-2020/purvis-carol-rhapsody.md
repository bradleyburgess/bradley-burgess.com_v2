We begin this evening with the wonderful _Carol Rhapsody_ by Richard Purvis, who
was an American organist and church musician, most known for his long
appointment as Organist and Master of Choristers at Grace Cathedral in San
Fransisco. His composition style was greatly influenced by the cathedral's
magnificent Aeolian-Skinner organ. It was one of the first true "American
Classic" organs, and the expressive, lush recordings he made on the instrument
influenced a generation of American organists. This piece takes us through
several well-loved carols, including lush and gentle Silent Night, and playful
scherzo on Hark the Herald Angels Sing, and ending with a rousing toccata on O
Come All Ye Faithful.
